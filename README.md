As you know, todays creating pawwords on different website are really cumbersome. That's why I have crated this repository as an assignment thorough "100 Days of Code" on Udemy. 
You can add your websites's password, and then you can search about that if you need that password. 
This code uses JSON data sturucture to store and search for entered data. 
Have Fun! :)
